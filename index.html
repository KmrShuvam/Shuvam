        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Blanch the peas, cauliflower florets, carrots and beans. Alternately, you can also boil them with a little water in the pressure cooker. Drain and mash coarsely. Heat oil in a pan and add three fourth quantity of onions. Saut√© till light golden in colour. Add green chillies and ginger-garlic paste. Stir-fry for half a minute. Add pav bhaji masala and chopped capsicum and stir fry for a minute.
</p>


<p><strong>Step 2: </strong> Ensure that you have finely chopped the tomatoes. If they have tough skin, chop them after removing the skin or grate them. Add tomatoes, salt and cook on medium heat for three to four minutes, stirring continuously or till oil separates from the masala. Add mashed peas, cauliflower, potatoes and 2 cups of water. Bring it to boil and simmer for ten minutes, pressing with back of the spoon a few times, till all the vegetables are completely mashed and blended together.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Heat half of the butter in a thick-bottomed pan or a tawa. Slice pav horizontally into two and pan fry in butter for half a minute, pressing two or three times or till pav is crisp and light brown. Garnish the bhaji with chopped coriander leaves, remaining butter and serve hot with pav accompanied with remaining chopped onion and lemon wedges.

</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>You can add finely chopped onions and green chillies to the bhaji. If you love to have your bhaji more spicy, add an extra teaspoon of red chilli powder while cooking the bhaji. You can also serve this bhaji with chapati or paratha or with plain bread.
